Thought Process:
- Create an Array of Arrays so it will be a 20*20 grid.
- Print out 400 consecutive numbers on the console and then on the browser
- find one of those numbers by entering a valid array search. For example (array[0][1]), would return 2.
- Instead of adding consecutive numbers, change it to a random $ amount.
- Add random event number(upto 400) to go along side the random $ amount.
- Return the event next to co-ordinate given.
- Return the two events either side of the co-ordinate given.
- Return the two events either side, and the event above or below (three nearest events)
- Browser asks for co-ordinate input.
- Returns results in the browser.
